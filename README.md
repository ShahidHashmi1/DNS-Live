## Description

This page is intended for users to identify concerts or musical events in a desired city, then provide information about those concerts/ events such as venue, date, time, youtube content, and ticketing information. 

## Installation

First we need to download a code viewer, such as VSCODE.

<p>Then we must have an open browswer with developer tools available, such as google chrome or mozilla firefox.</p>

<p>A VSCode extension such as live-server may be useful as well in viewing funcuntionality and changes as they're made in the browser.</p>
